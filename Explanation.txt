Step 1: Setup
Before running the code, ensure you have TensorFlow, NumPy, and Matplotlib installed. These libraries are essential for building, training, and visualizing the neural network model.

Step 2: Import Libraries
1. TensorFlow and Keras: Used for building and training the neural network.
2. MNIST dataset: A part of Keras datasets.
Sequential, Dense, Flatten: Keras components to build the neural network model.
3. to_categorical: A utility to convert class vectors to binary class matrices.
4. Matplotlib: Used for plotting graphs.

Step 3: Load and Preprocess the Data
1. Loading the dataset: The MNIST dataset is loaded, splitting into training and test sets.
2. Normalization: Pixel values of the images are scaled to the range [0, 1] by dividing by 255.0. This helps in speeding up the training process.
3. One-hot encoding: Labels are converted into a binary matrix format using to_categorical. For instance, a label '3' becomes [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
4. Printing shapes: Displays the dimensions of the training and test datasets.

Step 4: Build the Model
1. Model architecture:
       Flatten: Converts the 28x28 2D images into 1D vectors of size 784.
       Dense layer with ReLU: Fully connected layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation.
       Dense layer with softmax: Output layer with 10 neurons (one for each class) and softmax activation to output probabilities.

2. Compile the model:
      Optimizer: Adam optimizer is used for adjusting weights.
      Loss function: Categorical cross-entropy for measuring the error.
      Metrics: Accuracy to evaluate the performance.

3. Model summary: Prints the model architecture.

Step 5: Train the Model
1. Training the model:
     x_train, y_train: Training data.
     epochs=5: Number of times the entire dataset is passed through the network.
     validation_data: Data used to validate the model during training.

Step 6: Evaluate the Model
      Evaluate the model: Measures the model's performance on the test dataset. 
      test_loss, test_acc: Test loss and accuracy are printed.

Step 7: Visualize Training History
1. Plotting:
      Accuracy: Training and validation accuracy over epochs.
      Loss: Training and validation loss over epochs.
2. plt.figure: Creates a new figure.
3. plt.subplot: Creates subplots in a 1x2 grid.
4. plt.plot: Plots the values.

Step 8: Make Predictions
1. predictions: Predicts the labels for the test dataset.
2' plt.imshow: Displays images.
3. plt.title: Shows predicted and true labels.
4. argmax(): Returns the index of the maximum value (i.e., the predicted digit).
